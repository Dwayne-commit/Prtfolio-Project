                    <p>Hi my name is Dwayne McMorris I currently live in Jackson, Mississippi 
                        where I graduated from Jackson State University. At college I decided to become a Computer Engineer. 
                        After taking a few courses including Computer Science courses I decided that I liked coding especially the language 
                        Java. After taking more Computer Science courses and learning languages like C++, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, as well as linux
                        I decided after graduating that I would pursue a career in Software. I applied for jobs on Indeed and was hired by a company named Revature.
                        There I was placed into a batch and taught coding languages. The training or batch was very similar to a coding bootcamp the training was very 
                        difficult and included many hours of study. In these trainngs I learned languages like Python, MongoDB, MySQL, Java, Scala, and Angular. 
                        After graduation I and leaving Revature I decided to continue to pursue a career in Software engineering. <br>
